      <p>Hello JB Hi-Fi!</p>
      <p>
        I am writing today to express my interest in the full stack developer
        role you recently{' '}
        <a href="https://careers.jbhifi.com.au/cw/en/job/494787/senior-front-end-software-developer">
          advertised on you your website
        </a>
        . Being a full stack developer with over {yearsOfExperience} years
        experience I&apos;d like to throw my hat in the ring for consideration.
      </p>

        Sure! There were a couple of things in the ad that specifically stood
        out to me. I have a <q>strong working knowledge of ReactJS</q>, having
        spent the majority of my career working directly with these tools.
        Second, I absolutely love <q>mentoring and coaching team members</q>{' '}
        where appropriate. Over the last 18 months I've been enjoying stepping
        up into more of a leadership role and I'm now seeking an opportunity to
        use my unique skillset to help a team achieve the best we can. And
        finally, <q>attitude and aptitude are more important</q> is something I
        completely agree with. Every day I do my best to not only bring
        technical excellence to my work, but also a sense of fun and energy, and
        I love working with others who do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your listed requirements closely match my experience and skill set. A
        few that I would like to highlight that would make me a great fit for
        your team:
        <ul>
          <li>
            I currently work as a full stack developer at a well known online
            retailer. I have experience in delivering scalable solutions in a
            highly demanding and cutting edge industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have experience working as a project lead on large, complex
            projects. I have been focusing recently on further developing my
            leadership skills to enable all members of the team to achieve their
            best.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bulk of my work over the last couple of years has been with REST
            APIs and ReactJS, and I love it.
          </li>
        </ul>
